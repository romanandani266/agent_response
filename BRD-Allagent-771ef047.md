- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: If the system processes any payment information, PCI-DSS compliance is required.

### Compliance Requirements

#### GDPR Compliance
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect data that is necessary for the system's functionality.
- **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent from users before collecting personal data.
- **Right to Access and Erasure**: Implement features that allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
- **Data Protection by Design**: Incorporate data protection measures from the outset of the project.
- **Data Breach Notifications**: Establish procedures for notifying users and authorities in the event of a data breach.

#### PCI-DSS Compliance
- **Secure Network**: Implement firewalls and encryption to protect cardholder data.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to cardholder data to only those who need it.
- **Regular Monitoring and Testing**: Conduct regular security tests and audits to ensure data security.

### Security Measures
- **Encryption**: Use TLS for data in transit and AES-256 for data at rest.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control to ensure users have appropriate permissions.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain detailed logs of user activities and system access for auditing purposes.

### Data Privacy Rules
- **Data Anonymization**: Anonymize personal data where possible to enhance privacy.
- **Data Retention Policy**: Define and enforce a data retention policy to ensure data is not kept longer than necessary.

### Audit Controls
- **Regular Audits**: Schedule regular audits to ensure compliance with GDPR and PCI-DSS.
